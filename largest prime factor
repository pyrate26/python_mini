# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?


# variables declared

num = 100
my_primes = []

# 1st part of the program finding the prime nos first

for i in range(2,num):  		# i knew this :)
    isPrime = True    			# copied from youtube :(
    for j in range(2,i): 		# i knew this :)
       if i%j==0:       		# i knew this :)
           isPrime = False 		# copied from youtube :(
    if isPrime: 			# copied from youtube :(
        my_primes.append(i)  		# i knew this :)
print my_primes  			# i knew this :)
   

# 2nd part of the program find the prime factors ?????
